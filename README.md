# InfiniteTerrain
Godot project to create an infinite terrain to explore.  This was made in Godot 3.X, the tilemaps now work differently
in Godot 4 so the scripts in this project won't work.  I may try to update the code, or I may attempt a new version
using gridmaps and 3D tiles, I'm not sure yet.
